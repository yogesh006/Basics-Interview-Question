//Note "this"

// 1. this refers to an Object
// 2. The value of this depends on how the function is invoked

// Behaviour of this in a Function: this refers to window object 
// Behaviour of this in a object: this refers to the object

// Arrow Functions: Arrow function don't have a defined this. Instead they treat
// it as a variable and they try to get the value lexically (inherit from parent scope)
