//Condition
We compute the sum of the first k elements out of n terms using a linear loop and store the sum in variable window_sum.
Then we will graze linearly over the array till it reaches the end and simultaneously keep track of the maximum sum.
To get the current sum of a block of k elements just subtract the first element from the previous block and add the last element of the current block.
