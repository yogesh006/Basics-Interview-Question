//condition
Make a function where two pointers pointing to the linked list will be passed.
Now, check which value is less from both the current nodes
The one with less value makes a recursion call by moving ahead with that pointer and simultaneously append that recursion call with the node
Also put two base cases to check whether one of the linked lists will reach the NULL, then append the rest of the linked list. 


if(list1==null){
            return list2;
        }
        if(list2==null){
            return list1;
        }
        if(list1.val < list2.val){
            list1.next = mergeTwoLists(list1.next, list2);
            return list1;
        }
        else{
            list2.next = mergeTwoLists(list1, list2.next);
            return list2;
        }
